  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <h3>Loki/Hunter</h3>
  <h4>Web Developer</h4>
  <p>Hi, I'm Loki/Hunter. I'm currently a student at Sullivan University pursuing a Web Development certificate. I build clean, static websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’re looking for someone who codes with purpose and integrity — I’m your guy.</p>
  <h4>Background & Life</h4>
  <p>I grew up as a military brat, moving around a lot, which taught me how to adapt quickly and embrace change. Now, I’m focused on becoming a web developer, with hopes of working in government someday. I believe in working efficiently on what I love and learning to navigate challenges as they come.</p>
  <p>Growing up, I was a big gamer — mostly League of Legends, and before that, Halo and Call of Duty on Xbox. I also played EverQuest back in the early 2000s and was fascinated by it. Nowadays, I enjoy playing chess and welcome anyone who wants a friendly match. I play fairly fast but always think a few steps ahead.</p>
  <p>I attended high school in Washington State but now live on the East Coast in Louisville, KY. Life here is quieter, so I spend most of my time coding and gaming a bit before calling it a day. Friends call me casual, but I stay dedicated to learning and growing.</p>  
  <p>I am just starting to freelance and offer affordable web development services. My goal is to make people happy and show what I can do.</p>
