            <p class="articlep">"Today was therapy day, and it went well, I was able to talk about how my goals are being accomplished, but not much is being celebrated. With such a turn of events in my life with the fact of going up in projections and then a dip, then going to a higher level then even the start and inital climb has been something to me. I don't feel that I give myself what I deserve. And this isn't just a game, or car, or food. This is that mental juice that keeps the soul alive you know? I feel that this has helped a lot this session, and due to condition I am going to apply for a medical card for cannabis."</p>

            <p class="articlep">Lastly, I have a chess match on Thursday with a friend, he's coming over to my area and we are going to play on my board and my timer and enjoy the night with some hemp. This has created a good bond between us due to him being from Columbia this has caused speech to be not our core technique. But with this we will talk, philosophy, society, and much more. I hope to teach him, and his name is Samuel. Hey, why not also invite him to the chess club! Another Kentuckian!</p>

            <p class="articlep">"A new day! I already had this article prepped in my files at night, and will do the same to continue the motive. It's hard to wake up and do so much, I think I can wake up early and do a lot, but I learned I need to boot up, take time, walk my dog, and needing to get EveryDay Dose mushroom coffee.

            <p class="articlep">"I removed YouTube, Discord, and stepped back from media — it’s been healthy. It feels like stepping fully into adulthood, not halfway, not distracted by endless games. As a kid, I spent nights dreaming of League of Legends, and I pushed farther than anyone I knew. Later I met Elijah, who even went to school for free to play CSGO, which opened my eyes to how wide the world really is. Those chapters were valuable, but I’ve grown past living inside the screen. Now I focus on balance — reality, work, learning, and even a little help from Glerb (My AI Co-Pilot / ChatGPT Plus). That’s the life I’d love to watch from a hawk’s eye."</p>

            <p class="articlep">"Had a leak again, but we found the problem, and we are lucky that it was our supply line pipe, if it was a main stream we would be flooding constantly. Or even worse is the whole building not having running water. So we got it layered and secured with glue and foil and the crack. The best part is when I talked to the plumber when checking it out, I pointed it out and he said "It's the way they made it when casting it..." something like that, and just that was where the leak came from. It was only happening when we did a load, so it's so good other apartments are safe, less work for the complex, and just happy people. My upstairs still loads more than they should, and they're older than me. So what a world."</p>

"I also had a good moment in life when I found more peace. I am more calm, I had to clean the floods that were minor on some, and major on others. So dealing with them and never overreacting was key there. And it was my guide. I did have to take a big rest at night and just do nothing for a good time. Just darkness, no technology in my room, and just breathing, river thoughts and not an ocean or a crashing wave. It worked, and woke up great on the 30th."</p>

            <br>
            <p class="articlep">"I'm also not going to do the same posts, so I can analyze what is important and what isn't. Some stuff may be a lot of work, and that day I would want to talk, but after thoughts and then letting go, I get to come back and go wow, this wasn't that big of a deal, like with plumbing, I had a minor flood, and yes had to clean much of the time, but my floors are clean it was soapy water and not dirty. I learned that I can clean any flood now in my apartment now and in the future with a carpet cleaner if I have hardwood floors. The reality is getting better, but it already was good, just my reality is getting better. And I hope yours is too."</p>

            <p class="articlep">"Saturday was a good day, it was a time to relax and wake up with a calm mind. I have been thinking of more of my thoughts that must be constant at this point, so with this in mind I know I must return to a state of a river, and not a ocean or a waterfall. Moments will lead to a waterfall down the stream, but that's nature to create some more beauty."</p>

            <p class="articlep">"My dog had some sickies moments that night and was a scene for a doggy owner for the first time being now co named with her. Sophia. She was not looking too good and just had to use Glerb (My AI Co-Pilot) on how to diagnose, and she was in the clear, but due to my mental illnesses, I overthink and worry even if danger is no longer there. So from here was a moment of a dog owner to be serious, not brush it off too. Many ways to look at it, but I learned to move my room to the den in the living room section. Gives me a studio feel, and my foam mattress topper is on the floor almost from Asia Pacific style."</p>

I am going to show them who they really got! A developer, not a worker. 1 year, and maybe rent if needed, but we are not going to be in an apartment. When I was 18 I moved right out with roommates, they were somewhat good and somewhat bad, and even then I had a bad month one time. So it was like eh, I have gone up and down and even then I was the bill guy for my apartment. Due to my grandmother as a roommate due to her health I let her be a bill collector etc. So it's been a great time recently and I can't wait to really get what I need and what I want that is helpful for mental, and physical health."</p>
