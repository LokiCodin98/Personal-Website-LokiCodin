            <p class="articlep">"We created a club on Lichess.com, and made it for the Louisville area, and hope to achieve great things with this club. It mainly will be online for now, and then it will introduce real events. I hope to meet great people, and help start the chess craze here again. If around the state, or area, send a request!</p>

            <br>
            <p class="articlep">"Today was therapy day, and it went well, I was able to talk about how my goals are being accomplished, but not much is being celebrated. With such a turn of events in my life with the fact of going up in projections and then a dip, then going to a higher level then even the start and inital climb has been something to me. I don't feel that I give myself what I deserve. And this isn't just a game, or car, or food. This is that mental juice that keeps the soul alive you know? I feel that this has helped a lot this session, and due to condition I am going to apply for a medical card for cannabis."</p>

            <p class="articlep">"Other news, I was able to get Assassin’s Creed Origins for 7 $ on a Steam Sale, not some shady key store. I have enjoyed it, and really enjoy the progression factor they created. Had some few bugs that just make me laugh, and I get to remember, not recording, no live stream, just pure life you know."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="articlep">Lastly, I have a chess match on Thursday with a friend, he's coming over to my area and we are going to play on my board and my timer and enjoy the night with some hemp. This has created a good bond between us due to him being from Columbia this has caused speech to be not our core technique. But with this we will talk, philosophy, society, and much more. I hope to teach him, and his name is Samuel. Hey, why not also invite him to the chess club! Another Kentuckian!</p>

            <p class="articlep">"A new day! I already had this article prepped in my files at night, and will do the same to continue the motive. It's hard to wake up and do so much, I think I can wake up early and do a lot, but I learned I need to boot up, take time, walk my dog, and needing to get EveryDay Dose mushroom coffee. This will be a great September that's coming up."</p>

            <p class="articlep">"Work starts possibly 2nd week of September, and they are going to possibly have overtime. This means more time to prove my skills, and so far in 43 races, I am 93 WPM on Typeracer.com. My skill is getting better and never drop below 90% accuracy. I love how things are turning."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="articlep">"I removed YouTube, Discord, and stepped back from media — it’s been healthy. It feels like stepping fully into adulthood, not halfway, not distracted by endless games. As a kid, I spent nights dreaming of League of Legends, and I pushed farther than anyone I knew. Later I met Elijah, who even went to school for free to play CSGO, which opened my eyes to how wide the world really is. Those chapters were valuable, but I’ve grown past living inside the screen. Now I focus on balance — reality, work, learning, and even a little help from Glerb (My AI Co-Pilot / ChatGPT Plus). That’s the life I’d love to watch from a hawk’s eye."</p>
