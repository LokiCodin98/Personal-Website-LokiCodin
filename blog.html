            <p class="articlep">"It's been one week since the site has been up and so much has changed, and anxiety, or mind space has been much much better. After much talk with my therpaist, learning much, and hearing at 26, the moves I make and the effort I do for mental health, and daily life is above unusual to see. So I know this is great to see. Not  doing unusal things, but unsual so early. We hope to exceed but right now my goal is to relax. There is no timer or else, there is no failing now since you're not there. I'm 26, and doing a lot better than most. I even have 100k saved in retirment for Social already. So never failed at working, just didn't like my managers."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="articlep">"And with that said, there is much to say that managers do have awful teaching. I learned the best leader is the one who never wanted to be. And with how people want material, and more "finance" stablility. They lose much more step by step holding on to that belief. Your skill and creativity flow the cash just right. You don't need a bunch, you need enough. And I had enough with my mangers from no change, and after talking to higher representatives. I learend they even failed me. Am I a quitter? No, I did something most people have never done. And with that, you can too. With ANYTHING!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="articlep">"To end the post (ツ), let's end on a happy note too again. We stumble, but once you overlook that stumble, not once someone thinks you're okay, and not even your parents, you mainly rasied yourself to do what they did and didn't do. I learned mostly dont's my time being alive, I was preparing for this moment to be and adult. And I'm ready. If you're new like me but doing great, keep going, you're gonna do better than me at doing better at what nature and reality expects of our good selves and deeds."</p>
